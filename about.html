                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Dinesh Kumar, a web developer, Flutter app developer, and digital solutions freelancer specializing in building modern websites, mobile applications, and online business systems.
                     I help startups, small businesses, and personal brands grow through SEO-optimized websites, performance-focused design, and scalable digital solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                   My approach is simple: Developer + Growth. I don't just build products—I build systems that help your business get discovered, convert visitors into customers, and scale efficiently.
